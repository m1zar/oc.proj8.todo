## About the Todo application

The Todo application is a simple online Todo list manager. New Todos' may be added, marked as complete and deleted. Completed Todos' are clearly marked with a tick and crossed out text. A down arrow at the top left of the page allows select all. And view options at the bootom of the screen allow for different views based on the status of the Todo being All, Active or Completed. The Todos' are saved locally to the browser, and will be shown when the page is reloaded. You may also double-click a Todo to modify it. The page is clean and simple, and there is no advertising to slow it down, so response is immediate.
